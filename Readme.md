# The Project SBS Downloader
# This project was developed for the purpose of downloading SBS reports using the flet library. Developed by Arnold S. Condor - 2025
# The project is a simple example of how to use the flet library to create a GUI application that allows the user to download SBS reports.
# The project consists of a single page with four dropdowns for selecting the year, month, type entity, and report to download. The user can select the desired options and click the download button to start the download process.
# The project also includes a progress bar that shows the progress of the download process. The progress bar is updated as the download progresses, and a text label displays the current status of the download.
# The project uses the sbsUtils module to handle the download process. The download_report function is called when the user clicks the download button. The function retrieves the selected options from the dropdowns and uses them to construct the URL for the report download.
# The project demonstrates how to use the flet library to create a simple GUI application with interactive elements and event handling. The project is a good starting point for developers who want to create similar applications using the flet library.
# The project is open-source and available on GitHub. You can find the source code and documentation on the project's GitHub repository. Feel free to contribute to the project or use it as a reference for your own projects.
